# BizTalk_PrintSystem

🎓 This project is a **learning-oriented proof of concept** demonstrating how to use **Microsoft BizTalk Server** to automate a simple document handling and printing workflow.

## 🧠 Project Goal

To simulate a basic enterprise workflow where:
- Files are dropped into specific folders.
- BizTalk detects the files via **receive ports**.
- Data is processed and transformed via **pipelines** and **maps**.
- Output is redirected toward a simulated **print system** or logging system.

The goal was to explore the capabilities of BizTalk and learn how to integrate systems using drag-and-drop actions and BizTalk’s orchestration engine.

## 📁 Structure

- `Schemas/` – XML schemas used to validate input/output.
- `Maps/` – BizTalk maps used to transform data formats.
- `Orchestrations/` – Defines the logic flow.
- `Bindings/` – Environment-specific configuration files.
- `TestFiles/` – Example XML files to test the system.

## 🚀 Requirements

- Microsoft BizTalk Server (2013 or later recommended)
- Visual Studio with BizTalk Development Tools
- Optional: A virtual printer or console log for testing output

## 📝 Notes

- This is not a production-ready system.
- It was built to learn BizTalk fundamentals in an academic context.
